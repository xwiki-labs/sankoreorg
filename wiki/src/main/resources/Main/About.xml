  <content>1 About Curriki

#titlebar("Curriki is Your World of Educational Resources and Curriculum" "Join now" "Main.JoinSankore" "purple")
Curriki is more than your average Website; we're a community of educators, learners and committed education experts who are working together to create quality materials that will benefit teachers and students around the world.

Curriki is an online environment created to support the development and free distribution of world-class educational materials to anyone who needs them. Our name is a play on the combination of 'curriculum' and 'wiki' which is the technology we're using to make education universally accessible.

#subtitlebar("Who Are We?" "" "" "purple")
Curriki is the result of work done for GELC - the Global Education and Learning Community - an online project started by Sun Microsystems to develop works for education in a collaborative effort. The leadership team consists of people with a long-time commitment to exploring the use of technology to improve education.

#subtitlebar("Curriki is a Community" "See our partners" "Main.Partners" "purple")
In addition to members like you, we have support and funding from a variety of partners. These are individuals and organizations that are convinced that making world-class materials freely available to educators around the world is a key part of improving children's learning.

These early members and supporters are educators and organizations that believe in Curriki's approach of using technology to provide freely available learning resources. They have generously allowed us to utilize existing materials and have created resources especially for Curriki, as well.
