&lt;h1&gt;Congratulations on creating a group on Curriki!&lt;/h1&gt;

As the group leader, you must take a few additional steps for completing your group set-up.

Please review the following list and click "Continue" when you are ready to enter and explore your new group space.

(You can always locate the information below in the Groups area of the [Curriki Help Collection&gt;http://www.curriki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Coll_curriki/CurrikiHelp].)

*Invite Members*

Your group is ready to be populated with any Curriki members you want to include. From the Members tab, click the "Invite" button and start building your group membership!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also let friends or colleagues who haven’t yet joined Curriki know about your group; once they become Curriki members, they can become members of your group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

*Upload a Custom Group Image or Logo*

Your group’s "masthead" appears in multiple places, including the top of your group Home tab and in listings of groups in Curriki’s main site or a member’s My Curriki. Currently, your masthead shows the basic Curriki Group image. Click "Edit" for the top section of your Home tab to replace this Curriki-provided placeholder with your own group image.

*Add a Welcome or Introduction*

Enter a welcome note or introduction for group members or visitors by clicking "Edit" for the second section showing on the Home tab. Customize this area once to describe group goals or projects, or update it regularly to highlight group news. Note that if you do not click "Edit" for this area, it will not appear for regular group members. (As with the "Edit" links that you can see throughout your group pages, only a group leader can see this section.)

*Introduce Group Tabs*

The other Tabs in your group’s space -- Messages, Curriculum, Members, and Documentation -- offer an "About" section at the top where you can provide information or instructions. If you do not click "Edit" for these "About" messages to add custom content, the Curriki-provided text will appear.

*Start a Group Collection*

Will your group be sharing and creating curriculum resources using the Curriki repository and Currikulum Builder? Click "Add a Group Collection" on the Curriculum tab to begin developing or organizing your group’s resources.

#if($doc.name=="CreateNewGroup")
&lt;form action="$newspace.getHomeURL()" method="get"&gt;
#else
&lt;form action="" method="get" onsubmit="$('groups_firsttimewelcome').style.display='none'; return false;"&gt;
#end
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" value="Continue" /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</content>
